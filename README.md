Using the Discord client you should have a pretty solid understanding
of multitasking, if you're coming from javascript this is just known
as async calls. In this API they're called 'async' if you're building

'async' and 'await' calls. I don't want to go through and translate 
all these, upgrade or die! Just kidding, you can go make your own branch.
